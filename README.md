this is a css finale project from odin 
Big love to The Odin Project. They had me leveling up like every day was a new quest.
Didn’t think coding would grab me like this, but here I am, hooked like it’s a whole new hustle.
Every lesson felt like another bar dropped, another skill unlocked, another step closer to building real stuff.

Shoutout to the community too. The guidance, the structure, the grind…
It all pushed me forward.
I’m in this now.
Locked in.
Building.
Practicing.
Growing.

This journey is fun as hell, and I’m just getting started.
